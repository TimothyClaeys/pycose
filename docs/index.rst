``pycose`` a Python implementation of CBOR Object Signing and Encryption

What is COSE?
-------------

CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE_) is a data format for concise representation of small messages. It is optimized for
low-power devices. COSE messages can be encrypted, MAC'ed and signed. The basic structure of a COSE message consists of
2 information buckets and the payload:

- **Protected header**: This message field contains information that needs to be protected. This information is taken into account during the encryption, calculation of the MAC or the signature.
- **Unprotected header**: The information contained in the unprotected header is not protected by the cryptographic algorithms.
- **Payload**: Contains the payload of the message (protected by the cryptographic algorithms).

There are 6 different types of COSE messages:

- **Encrypt0**: An encrypted COSE message with a single recipient. The payload and AAD are protected by a shared CEK (Content Encryption Keys)
- **Encrypt**: An encrypted COSE message can have multiple recipients. For each recipient the CEK is encrypted with a KEK (Key Encryption Key) - using AES key wrap - and added to the message.
- **MAC0**: An authenticated COSE message with one recipient.
- **MAC**: An authenticated COSE message that can have multiple recipients. For each recipient, the authentication key is encrypted with a KEK and added to the message.
- **Sign1**: A signed COSE message with a single signature.
- **Sign**: A COSE message that has been signed by multiple entities (each signature is carried in a COSE signature structure, added to the message).

Based on the message type, extra fields are appended to the basic COSE structure:

- A single *MAC* field or a single *signature* field (for **MAC0** or **Sign1** messages)
- A list of *COSE recipients* or a list of *COSE signatures* (for **MAC**, **Encrypt**, and **Sign** messages)

Besides the different COSE messages, the RFC also defines COSE Key objects. COSE Keys are used to store and transport
cryptographic keys. There are three main key types:

- **EC2**: Elliptic Curve Keys with an x/y-coordinate pair.
- **OKP**: Octet Key Pair
- **Symmetric**: Symmetric Keys for symmetric cryptography
